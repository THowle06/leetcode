# 49. Group Anagrams

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topics:** Array, Hash Table, String

---

## 📝 Problem Summary

Given an array of strings `strs`, group all *anagrams* together into sublists. You may return the output in **any order**.

An **anagram** is a string that contains the exact same characters as another strin, but the order of the characters can be different.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: strs = ["act","pots","tops","cat","stop","hat"]

Output: [["hat"],["act", "cat"],["stop", "pots", "tops"]]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: strs = ["x"]

Output: [["x"]]
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: strs = [""]

Output: [[""]]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` is made up of lowercase English letters.

## Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(m * n)

Space complexity:

- O(m) extra space.
- O(m * n) space for the output list.

- Where `m` is the number of strings and `n` is the length of the longest string.
